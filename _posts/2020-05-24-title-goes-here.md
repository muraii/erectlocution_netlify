> Because individual identity is partly constituted (or “constructed”) by culture and social relations, there is no coherent way of formulating individual rights or interests in abstraction from social contexts. In particular, according to these communitarians, there is no point in attempting to found a theory of justice on principles that individuals would choose in a hypothetical state of ignorance of their social, economic, and historical circumstances (from behind a Rawlsian “veil of ignorance”), because such individuals cannot exist, even in principle.

I'm trying to get a throughline on how people arrive at such disparate points of view about, well, I don't even know how to codify it. It's not just that people think differently about what may constitute human rights, it's that they think differently about what in others they should honor and respect as sacrosanct. Human life itself is variably important. It's easy to fall into one or another ideology but I'd like to think through it more, even if I end up in an ideology anyway.

Why do people [cough and spit on people during a viral pandemic](https://twitter.com/perlmutations/status/1263855443832475648?s=20), for instance? There is a chain of reasoning that renders that sensible to some folks. Without knowing that chain though the behavior just looks absolutely pathologically vile. Which isn't to say that diagramming that reasoning graph makes the act necessarily not vile. I just can't fathom what concept of freedom or vigilant automony moves someone to do something like this, let alone be _proud_ of it.

I started digging. I think understanding how the notions of individualism and collectivism have developed and affected schools of thought is a good place to start. I found, curiously enough, a really well-articulated article in the Encyclopedia Britannica of all places, entitled ["Communitarianism"](https://www.britannica.com/topic/communitarianism#ref1103845). The site itself is a rendering nightmare; it's crashed its Firefox tab at least a couple of times. But the content covers lots of ground and is a great collection of trailheads.

My working model for understanding how the liberal and conservative factions of American society can't seem to reconcile anything rests on the observation that they each start from a different foundation, from two types of worldview whose axioms are incompatible. They each define priorities and importance based on, whether the individual or the collective is fundamental (the implication being that they are dichotomous).
