> Because individual identity is partly constituted (or “constructed”) by culture and social relations, there is no coherent way of formulating individual rights or interests in abstraction from social contexts. In particular, according to these communitarians, there is no point in attempting to found a theory of justice on principles that individuals would choose in a hypothetical state of ignorance of their social, economic, and historical circumstances (from behind a Rawlsian “veil of ignorance”), because such individuals cannot exist, even in principle.

I'm trying to get a throughline on how people arrive at such disparate points of view about all manner of issue. Why do people [cough and spit on people during a viral pandemic](https://twitter.com/perlmutations/status/1263855443832475648?s=20), for instance? There is a chain of reasoning that sweeps a person to find that behavior a logical extension of their beliefs. Without knowing that chain though the behavior just looks absolutely pathologically vile.

Which isn't to say that diagramming that reasoning graph makes the act necessarily not vile. I just can't fathom what concept of freedom or vigilant automony moves someone to do something like this.
